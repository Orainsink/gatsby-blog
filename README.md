1. how to deploy

   change package.json

   ```json
   "scripts": {
   	...
   	"deploy": "gatsby build --prefix-paths && gh-pages -d public -r https:......",
   }
   ```

   Maybe you need to read [this article](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-and-hosting/)

2. How to write posts

   ```shell
   yarn new aaa
   ```

   this command will create a `aaa.md` file in `/content/blog`

   ```shell
   yarn new /aaa
   ```

   this will create a path `/content/blog/aaa/` and generate a `aaa.md` file.

3. How to change styles and components

   This blog isn't complex at all, each component has a `less` module file in `styles/` corresponding to it. You can easily change them if you know how to write react hooks.

   You can change global less vars by modifying `gatsby-config.js`

4. As I say, this blog is a personal project for practicing, so there are no special optimizations for extensibility or customization. you need to change a few details yourself .
